This is my first completed HTML project.

In this project, I demonstrated what I learned in the HTML section of The Odin Project's Foundations course.
This project was a fun way to demonstrate the use of boilerplates, tags, lists, paragraphs, etc.
The project took several hours to complete, and I am happy with the final product, considering it is my first ever coded project with HTML.
In addition, this project taught me how to efficiently use git, git staging, and git committing, as well as other git workflow standard practice.

While this project is simple, this taught me a lot in regards to the structure of websites and the importance of git in development.
